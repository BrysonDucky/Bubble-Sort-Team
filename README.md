Repository for the first project.

1. Need to have Python installed on your machine to test.
2. Also need to import the "matplotlib" library.

Prerequisites for installing Python and Pip for the necessary library.
  1. Download python from the Python website.
  2. Open command prompt to verify Python is installed. Command to run: python3 --version. If you get a response 
         (ex: Python 3.10.9) then you have python properly installed.
  4. Install pip. Necessary for downloading matplotlib (and other Python libraries). More info here: 
         https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-pip-latest-version/
  5. Once pip is installed run this command in a command prompt: python get-pip.py
  6. (In the same command prompt) To install the library: pip install matplotlib.
  8. Should be able to run the program in VSCode.

Command to run in the terminal for testing: python3 BubbleSortVisualize.py
